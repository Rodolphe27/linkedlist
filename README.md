# Python Singly Linked List Implementation

This Python program demonstrates the implementation of a singly linked list data structure. A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node in the sequence. This implementation allows you to create and manipulate a singly linked list.

## Usage

To use the provided linked list implementation, follow these steps:

1. Import the `LinkedList` and `Node` classes from the `linked_list.py` module:

   ```python
   from linked_list import LinkedList, Node
